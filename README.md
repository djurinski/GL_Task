# GL_Task

Frequency class contains algorithm from task, called from main.
Few comments:
  -there is definitely a better option for sorting map than one implemented here
  -comparator does not have a return value for equal, but in this algorithm it's not possible to have same maps compared
  - the algorithm works only with English alphabet ( no č, ć etc.) but it can be easily fixed work
